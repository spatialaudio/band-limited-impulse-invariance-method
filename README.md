# Band Limited Impulse Invariance Method

Supplementary material for the paper entitled "Band limited impulse invariance method" (Manuscript in preparation).

The python scripts generate the following figures:

* The full-band and band-limited impulse responses of a one-pole system are shown

* Digital modeling of an analog filter using the conventional impulse invariance method

* Digital modeling of an analog filter using the proposed band-limited impulse invariance method
